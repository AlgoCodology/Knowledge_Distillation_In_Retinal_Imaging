# Knowledge_Distillation_In_Retinal_Imaging
The project was a part of the internship work conducted at Thirona B.V. as a part of the Master's in Artificial intelligence course with Maastricht University, The Netherlands

The project covers applying the innovations suggested in various works int he domain of Knowledge distillation. Knowledge distillation has been applied to Fundus images in the Diabetic Retinopathy and Glaucoma datasets that come under retinal imaging. The distilled models show statistically significant superior performance compared to the undistilled counterparts. This enables the migration of ML models to point-of-care devices with limited computational capacity while keeping the prediction times under check.
